# Change Log

## [2.1.0] - 2023-09-12
- The NewEnvi() function returns the envi struct itself instead of an interface
- Added functionality for easy loading yaml, json and plain content in files from file paths that are set in environment variables

## [2.0.0] - 2021-02-11

This is more or less a complete rewrite of the envi package.
The goal of the package stays the same, but it is easier to use different sources of envVars.
